CS:GO Demos and Network Messages
--------------------------------

Demos and network messages in CS:GO use Google's Protocol Buffers (protobuf). Protobuf is a message/object serialization language that generates code to serialize the objects efficiently. For information about protobuf, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview

`demoinfogo` is a tool that parses CS:GO demo files (ending in `.dem`) and dumps out every message in the demo. Using this tool, third parties can parse the demo for various game events to generate information and statistics.

Building demoinfogo
-------------------

### Windows

In order to build demoinfogo on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Download [protobuf-2.5.0.zip](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v2.5.0/protobuf-2.5.0.zip) and extract it into the `demoinfogo` folder. This creates the folder `demoinfogo/protobuf-2.5.0`.
2. Download the Protobuf compiler [protoc-2.5.0.zip](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v2.5.0/protoc-2.5.0-win32.zip) and extract it into the `demoinfogo/protoc-2.5.0-win32` folder.
3. Open `demoinfogo/protobuf-2.5.0/vsprojects/protobuf.sln` in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. Allow Visual Studio to convert the projects.
4. Build the *Release* configuration of `libprotobuf`. Building any other projects is not required.
5. Open `demoinfogo/demoinfogo.vcxproj` in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. Building the Release configuration creates the binary `demoinfogo/demoinfogo.exe`


Working with Network Messages
-----------------------------

Building demoinfogo generates C++ classes from the network protobuf files. Follow these steps to generate these files for use in your application without building demoinfogo

1. Follow step 1 and 2 above for extracting Protobuf 2.5.0 and protoc 2.5.0.
2. Run `make_cc_files.bat`. The generated C++ files are created in the `generated_proto` subdirectory.

You can now use the generated classes in your C++ code to send user messages. Here is an example of how to send the HintText message:

```
CSingleUserRecipientFilter filter( this );
filter.MakeReliable();
CCSUsrMsg_HintText msg;
msg.set_text( "ExampleHint" );
SendUserMessage( filter, CS_UM_HintText, msg );
```
